# Challenge 2: Man-in-the-Middle Attack (Session Hijacking)

For this challenge, players were given a **DNS server address (192.168.153.10)** and a **website (http://valentine.com)** which is also accessible with **(192.168.153.10)**. The first step was to connect to the previously cracked Wi-Fi network and set this DNS server as the primary one. Additionally, the victim‚Äôs IP address **(192.168.153.30)** was provided, giving a crucial clue about the target.

## Analyzing the Task

At first glance, one might assume this challenge involves web exploitation, such as attacking the login page. However, that‚Äôs a **red herring** ‚Äî this is a network-based challenge, and testing the login form won‚Äôt lead anywhere. Instead, the task description hints that **the victim frequently visits the website**, suggesting that intercepting their traffic might be the key.

## Inspecting Network Traffic

Firing up **Wireshark**, we apply a filter to monitor traffic from the victim‚Äôs IP:

```bash
ip.addr == 192.168.153.30
```

Surprisingly, all we see are **mDNS packets**, which aren‚Äôt useful for our goal. Why? Because **WPA2 encryption ensures that communication between the victim and the server is secure**, preventing passive eavesdropping. This means we **can‚Äôt** simply sniff the victim‚Äôs HTTP requests directly.

## Performing an ARP Poisoning Attack

Since passive sniffing is ineffective, we need another approach: a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack**. But before diving into the attack, let‚Äôs quickly go over how devices forward traffic using **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).**

## How ARP Works

When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it first checks its **ARP table** for the corresponding MAC address. If the IP address isn‚Äôt in the table, it sends a **broadcast ARP request**, and the device with that IP responds with its MAC address. This allows proper packet forwarding within the local network.

### What is ARP Poisoning?

![ARP Poisoning Diagram](/assets/darkest/poison.webp)

**ARP Poisoning** is an attack where the attacker **spoofs ARP replies**, making both the victim and the server believe that the attacker‚Äôs MAC address belongs to the other party. This way, all traffic between them is **redirected through the attacker‚Äôs machine**, effectively placing us in the middle of their communication.

Now, let‚Äôs execute the attack.

## Step 1: Enable IP Forwarding

Since we need to relay traffic between the victim and the server, we must enable **IP forwarding** on our machine:

```bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

This ensures that traffic received from one party is forwarded to the intended destination instead of being dropped.

## Step 2: Launch ARP Poisoning with Ettercap

There are multiple tools to perform ARP poisoning, but **Ettercap** is simple and comes pre-installed on Kali Linux.

1. Start Ettercap and select the network interface.
2. Scan for active hosts.
3. Add **192.168.153.30 (victim)** and **192.168.153.10 (server)** to **Target 1.**
4. Start **ARP poisoning** between them.

Once the attack is active, our machine will intercept all traffic between the victim and the website.

## Step 3: Capturing HTTP Traffic

Now, we open **Wireshark** again and filter for HTTP traffic.

At first, there‚Äôs a flood of ARP packets ‚Äî expected behavior, as our device keeps **broadcasting spoofed ARP responses** to maintain the MITM attack. But when we apply a ‚Äúhttp‚Äù filter, we finally spot something interesting:

### Intercepted HTTP POST Request

We see a **POST request** sent by the victim to http://valentine.com/login :

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1  
Host: valentine.com  
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 72

username=admin&password=5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

The password appears to be a **hash** (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99) but immediately after the login request, we see a server response:

```http
GET /welcome HTTP/1.1  
Host: valentine.com  
Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.Z72rgg.VonkdelMk5vsR2MddI8vAlWxId0
```

Here, we find something far more valuable: the **session cookie**!

## Step 4: Hijacking the Session

Instead of cracking the password, we can **bypass authentication entirely** by using the captured session cookie. We simply add the cookie to our browser and visit http://valentine.com/welcome :

```
Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.Z72rgg.VonkdelMk5vsR2MddI8vAlWxId0
```

And just like that, **we‚Äôre logged in as the victim!** üéâ

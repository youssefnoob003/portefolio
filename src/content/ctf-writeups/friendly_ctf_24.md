As part of **Friendly CTF 2024**, one of the largest beginner-oriented CTFs of the year — with over **500 teams** and **124 challenges** — I contributed by creating a set of challenges under the **MISC / Forensics and Malware Analysis** category.

My goal was to design tasks that were approachable yet meaningful, helping participants explore real-world cybersecurity problems through hands-on scenarios. These challenges focused on fundamental investigative techniques that are often critical in real environments but rarely emphasized in beginner competitions.

The challenge set included:

- **File Forensics** — Extracting insights from hidden or damaged files.
- **Steganography** — Concealing and uncovering data within media.
- **Malware Analysis** — Interpreting basic obfuscated code to understand attacker intent.
- **Network Forensics** — Tracing leaks and suspicious activity in packet captures.

Each challenge was crafted to reward curiosity, careful analysis, and creative thinking — the exact mindset required in actual incident response and digital investigations.

These exercises emphasized the importance of:

- Understanding how data can be manipulated or hidden  
- Applying practical tools in controlled environments  
- Thinking critically under realistic constraints

**Friendly CTF 2024** succeeded in introducing hundreds of new players to core cybersecurity principles in a supportive and engaging environment. I'm proud to have contributed to that mission and to have helped make forensics and malware analysis approachable and fun for first-timers.
